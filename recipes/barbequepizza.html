    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe for classic BBQ chicken pizza with 
    tangy BBQ sauce, chicken, and red onion.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons of your favorite bbq sauce</li>
        <li>2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 cup of shredded smoked gouda cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped or shredded cooked chicken</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven 
            to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and 
            allow it to rest as the oven preheats</li>
        <li>To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, 
            brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, 
            push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with 1/3 
            cup BBQ sauce. Toss the cooked chicken with the remaining BBQ sauce, then scatter all around the pizza. 
            Add the cheeses and red onion</li>
        <li>Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh cilantro, if desired. 
                Slice hot pizza and serve immediately</li>
        <li>Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza 
            slices can be frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough</li>
    </ol>
