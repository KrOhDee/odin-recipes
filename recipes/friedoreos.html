    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Deep Fried Oreos are an easy and fun treat for special occasions! Only a few ingredients are needed 
        to make the batter crusted, powdered sugar dusted sweet indulgence!</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oreo cookies</li>
        <li>Bisquick</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the batter 
            ingredients together until smooth, in a medium-large bowl</li>
        <li>Dip one Oreo at a time into the batter to coat, and using a fork, 
            remove the cookie from the batter, tapping off excess batter. 
            You don't want all the batter to drip off, but any excess just tap lightly</li>
        <li>Place the Oreo directly into oil, heated up to 350°F in a deep Dutch oven. You want the 
            oil to be at least 3- inches deep in the pot for a true “deep fry”.
             It just makes the process easier than going skimpy on the oil</li>
        <li>Allow the Oreos to fry for 3-ish minutes on each side until they are golden brown</li>
        <li>Transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to cool</li>
        <li>Once they are no longer hot you can dust them with powdered sugar</li>

    </ol>
